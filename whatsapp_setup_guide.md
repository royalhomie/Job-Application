# WhatsApp Notifications Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you set up WhatsApp notifications for your job application system. When someone submits an application, you'll receive an instant WhatsApp message with all the details.

## Method 1: CallMeBot (Free & Easy)

### Step 1: Get Your WhatsApp API Key

1. **Open WhatsApp** on your phone
2. **Send this message** to `+34 644 51 95 23`:
   ```
   /start
   ```
3. **You'll receive a response** with your API key
4. **Copy the API key** (it looks like: `123456789`)

### Step 2: Update Your .env File

Replace the placeholder values in your `.env` file:

```bash
WHATSAPP_API_KEY=123456789
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

**Important Notes:**

- Replace `123456789` with your actual API key
- Replace `+1234567890` with your phone number including country code
- Example: If you're in the US with number 555-123-4567, use `+15551234567`

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. Restart your server: `npm start`
2. Submit a test application
3. Check your WhatsApp for the notification

## Method 2: WhatsApp Business API (Advanced)

### Step 1: Set Up WhatsApp Business Account

2. Create a business account
3. Get your API credentials

### Step 2: Update Configuration

Replace the webhook URL in `server.js` with your WhatsApp Business API endpoint.

## Method 3: Alternative Services

### Option A: Twilio WhatsApp

2. Get your Account SID and Auth Token
3. Update the WhatsApp function in `server.js`
